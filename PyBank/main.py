##In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".#Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:#The total number of months included in the dataset#The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period#The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes#The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period#The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period##Your analysis should align with the following results:#Financial Analysis#----------------------------#Total Months: 86#Total: $22564198#Average Change: $-8311.11#Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)#Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)#In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.#import modulesimport osimport csv#list path of the filebudget_data = os.path.join('Resources','budget_data.csv')#set variablestotal_months = 0profitloss = []previous_profitloss = 0profitloss_change = 0change_list =[]month_change = []# set output path for text filetext_out = os.path.join('analysis', 'pybank.txt')# Open and read csvwith open(budget_data) as csv_file:    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=",")    # Read the header row first     csv_header = next(csv_reader)    print(f"Header: {csv_header}")    first_row = next(csv_reader)    total_months+= 1     profitloss.append(int(first_row[1]))    previous_profitloss = float(first_row[1])    #loop through to find the total number of months, create a list of profit/loss    for row in csv_reader :        total_months+= 1         profitloss.append(int(row[1]))    #add all the values together from "profit/losses" to get the total        total_profitloss = (sum(profitloss))        #calculate average change        profitloss_change = float(row[1])- previous_profitloss        previous_profitloss = float(row[1])        change_list += [profitloss_change]        month_change += [row[0]]    profitloss_average = sum(change_list)/len(change_list)#find max (greates increase in profits) date and amountgreatest_increase = max(change_list)#find min (greatest decrease in profits) date and amountgreatest_decrease = min(change_list)print('Total Months:',total_months)    print(f'Total: ${total_profitloss}')print(f'Average Change: ${profitloss_average:,.2f}')print(f'Greatest Increase in Profits: ${greatest_increase:,.2f}')print(f'Greatest Decrease in Profits: ${greatest_decrease:,.2f}')#write changes to txtwith open(text_out, 'w') as file:    file.write("Financial Analysis\n")    file.write("---------------------\n")    file.write("Total Months: %d\n" % total_months)    file.write("Total Revenue: $%d\n" % total_profitloss)    file.write("Average Change $%d\n" % profitloss_average)    file.write("Greatest Increase in Profits: $%d \n" % greatest_increase)    file.write("Greatest Decrease in Profits: $%d \n" % greatest_decrease)
