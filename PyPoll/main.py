##In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.#You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:    #The total number of votes cast    #A complete list of candidates who received votes    #The percentage of votes each candidate won    #The total number of votes each candidate won    #The winner of the election based on popular vote#Your analysis should align with the following results:#Election Results#-------------------------#Total Votes: 369711#-------------------------#Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)#Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)#Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)#-------------------------#Winner: Diana DeGette#-------------------------#In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.#import modulesimport osimport csv#list path of the fileelection_data = os.path.join('Resources','election_data.csv')# set output path for text filetext_out = os.path.join('analysis', 'pypoll.txt')#set variablestotal_votes = 0votes = dict()# Open and read csvwith open(election_data) as csv_file:    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=",")    # Read the header row first (skip this part if there is no header)    csv_header = next(csv_file)    print(f"Header: {csv_header}")        #calculate total votes    for row in csv_reader :        total_votes+= 1        c_name = row[2]        if c_name not in votes:             votes[c_name] = 0        votes[c_name] +=1            winner = str(max(votes, key=votes.get))percentage_votes = f'{(votes[c_name]/total_votes):.2%}'#print out resultsprint('Total Votes:',total_votes)#print out candidates names, total votes, and percentage of the votefor c_name in votes:    print(c_name,votes[c_name], percentage_votes)    print('Winner:',winner)#write changes to txtwith open(text_out, 'w') as file:    file.write("Election Results\n")    file.write("---------------------\n")    file.write("Total Votes: %d\n" % total_votes)    file.write(("---------------------\n"))    for key, val in votes.items():       new_line = key + " " + str(val) + " " + percentage_votes        file.write(new_line)       file.write("\n")    file.write("---------------------\n")    file.write("Winner: ")      file.write(winner)
